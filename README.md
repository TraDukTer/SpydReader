# SpydReader

SpydReader is a Python-based Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) speed-reading aid developed by TraDukTer (J. Suutarinen). As an RSVP solution, it may also be used for peripheral vision reading.

# 1. Description

SpydReader flashes words (or groups of words) from an input text in the center of a configurable area to force the user to read the words quickly or miss them on the one hand, and to remove the mental overhead of moving the text along on the other. Research on the effects of RSVP on reading speed and comprehension are mixed, but I have found it useful in skimming uninteresting texts. RSVP can also be used to aid in reading with peripheral vision by those whose whose central vision is diminished, who may find it difficult to follow conventionally displayed text without centering it in their vision.

As of January 2025, I am developing SpydReader on my own and am not looking for contributors at this time. I intend to develop SpydReader alone into some kind of minimum lovable product and an entry into my personal programming portfolio. I welcome feedback and input on e.g. future features via my GitHub account, and don't rule out co-operating with other developers at a later date.. 

## 1.2. Features

1. Input text

SpydReader currently supports input as .txt file and raw text input to the text-based user interface. The .txt file is read into memory in its entirety, so some software limitations to its length apply. The file name can be arbitrary, but the file has to be placed in the /Input folder in the same folder as SpydReader.

2. Interface

SpydReader is currently completely text-based and runs in a terminal. 

Controls while displaying text:
Space:      pause/unpause
Up arrow:   increase speed of text (decrease interval between words shown)
Down arrow: decrease speed of text (increase interval between words shown)

## 1.2. Known issues

Due to being a work in progress, SpydReader currently blocks keyboard interrupt and does not have a feature to close it without closing it other than closing the terminal instance that ran it.

## 1.3 Planned Features

1. Input text

- Saving progress on .txt files
- Reading large files piecemeal
- Support for other file types
- Support for specifying an input file's path to the program

2. Interface

- A control feature to exit the program gracefully
- Control features to move backwards and forwards in text
- Displaying several words at a time in various configurations of rows
- Override to enter specific values for text progress and display speed while display is paused
    - instead of incrementing gradually
- Displaying progress in current text
- Verbose in-program descriptions of controls

- configuration file
- running from console with input file etc. as argument to bypass repetitive logic
- Saving progress on a given input file
    - na√Øve validation (with option to override) that the file is unchanged from previous session

- Dedicated TUI (instead of relying on a third-party terminal. Would improve flickering)
- GUI (not a priority)

- All features are intended to be retained despite adding new ones;
    - Terminal mode will be supported when TUI mode is implemented
    - TUI mode will be supported if and hen GUI mode is implemented. 

3. Implementation

- A standalone .exe (would also allow e.g. packaging Keyboard library)


# 2. Requirements

SpydReader uses the [PyPi Keyboard library](https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/), which is not provided with Python installation. To run the source code, you need to install the Keyboard library, e.g. by running `pip install keyboard` in a commandline.
